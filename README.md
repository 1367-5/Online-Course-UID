# Online-Course-UID
网课唯一标识符（UID）是一种分配给每门特定课程的独特代码，可以在所有提供该课程的平台上使用。这确保了无论该课程在哪个平台上托管，都可以通过其UID明确识别。

A unique identifier (UID) for an online course is a distinct code assigned to each specific course, and it can be used across all platforms that offer the course. This ensures that the course can be clearly identified by its UID regardless of the platform hosting it.
